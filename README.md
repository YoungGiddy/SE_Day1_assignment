#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry: 
    Software engineering is a systematic approach the development and maintenance of software.
      importance: 1. ensuring quality and maintainable software
                  2. Supports economic growth

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.  
  1. The software crisis
  2. Introduction of structuredprogramming
  3. Object-Oriented programming

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
   1.REQUIREMENTS GATHERING: ths is where the projects goal andfeasibility study is done.
   2.REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS: this is where the requirements gathered are analysed.
   3.DESIGN:this is where a blueprint of the system is made
   4.CODING: this is where the code is written

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
      1. agile ,model is highly flexibe compared to waterfall model
      2. Agile model has adaptable requirements whike those of waterfall model are fixed
  Agile model is suitable to design projects with evolving requirements e.g developing a mobile app, on the ther hand
  waterfall model is suitable for projects with fixed requirements  e.g a payroll system. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
     SOFTWARE DEVELOPER: 1.Writing and maintaining code
                         2.Testing and debugging
                         3.Reviewing the code
                         4.Problem solving
     QUALITY ASSURANCE ENGINEER: 1.Forming a quality assurance team
                                 2.Developing strategues and plans
                                 3.Overseeing the testing process
      PROJECT MANAGER: 1.Project planning
                       2.Budget mamnagement
                       3.Schedule management
                       4.Risk management

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
   IDEs- supports various languages e.g Visual studio code lets you write your code in different languages
   VCS- These tracks and keeps changes made to your code and other files

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
        1. Time and budget constraints- this can be mitigated by planning the project based on the budget and time allocated
        2. Maintainig work-life balance- this can be done by adapting stress managemet skills

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
        UNIT TESTING- tests individual concepts. importance: catches bugs earlier in the development stage.
        INTEGRATION TESTING- Tests interaction between different modules. Importance: Verifies that different modules work together without any problem.
        SYSTEM TESTING- Tests the entire system as a whole importance: verifies that the system meets specified requirements.
        ACCEPTANCE TESTING- Tests the software from the end user's perspective. Importance:verifies that it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
  Promt engineering is an art of crafting questions to get suitable responses from AI models
   Importance
     It improves the AI models accuracy and reliability

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
    an example is "Desing me a students list" a clearer one will be" design me a students system used to upload their grades in each subject with five colimns with different entries that represent subjects"
    it is more effective as it lets the AI model to develop a more accurate system
